Fit a polynomial regression model as follows:\n","\n","First, fit & transform X using fit_transform and polynomial features of degree 2\n","Use this transformed X and y for fitting a linear regression model\n","Print the values of its coefficients and intercept in a file named 'output/output.csv'\n","6.
